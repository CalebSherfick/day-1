    <h1>Hello, Codeworks!</h1>
    <p>My name is Caleb Sherfick, and I am excited to be joining your class! Before we get started with the course, I
        would like to highlight a few aspects of life.</p>

    <h3>Some Things I Enjoy:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Playing Video Games</li>
        <li>Playing Guitar and Piano</li>
        <li>Playing Board Games</li>
        <li>Watching Television and Movies</li>
        <li>Eating some good Korean BBQ</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What was I Doing Before Codeworks?</h3>
    <p>Before I made the decision to attend a course at Boise Codeworks, I was working as a Sales Associate for a
        Software company by the name of KidCheck. At KidCheck, I was responsible for selling software, but all I was
        really interested in was being the one to create it. I was studying code on my own, but not learning nearly as
        quickly as I had wanted. I wanted to start doing what I loved for a living as quickly as possible so I enrolled
        into Codeworks and am now on the path I have been desiring for so many years now.</p>

    <h3>Plans After Codeworks</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Get a better job than I had before, where I love going into work and enjoy what I'm doing. </li>
        <li>Buy a house</li>
        <li>Start traveling and seeing the world</li>
        <li>Create my own software on the side for fun and practice</li>
        <li>Keep learning and expanding my knowledge</li>
    </ul>
